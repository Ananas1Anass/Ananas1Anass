- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ananas1Anass
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics, building things from scratch. ...
- 🌱 I’m currently majoring in Electronics at ENSEIRB-MATMECA,The École nationale supérieure d’électronique, informatique, télécommunications, mathématique et mécanique de Bordeaux (ENSEIRB-MATMECA) which is a grande école (French engineering school) located in Bordeaux specialized in Electrical Engineering, Electronics, Computer Science, Telecommunications, Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics.
- 👀 I'm also a member of EIRBOT, which is the robotics association of ENSEIRB-MATMECA. The school's four departments create an ideal setting to build robots. EIRBOT's main goal is to participate to the French Robotics Cup, which is part of the Eurobot Open. The association has been designing and building robots from scratch since 2003 (before that, EIRBOT was known as the Robotics Club of ENSEIRB-MATMECA).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project on either Robotics, aeronautics or simply coding challenges...
